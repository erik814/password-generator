# Random Password Generator

## Description

This website is intended to help people come up with a unique random password.

Using the website is really simple. First the user clicks on the "Generator Pasword" button. A series of questions will show up for them to answer in the form of pop-ups. They will need to select length of password and which characters they want to allow: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.

Finally, a password will be generated that meets all of their criteria.

## Tasks

For this project, I was already given the HTML and CSS for the entire page, as well as a little bit of JavaScript. My task was to write the JavaScript to get the website functioning as intended. In doing so I ended up creating A LOT of variables.

## What I Learned

There were several key takeaways from this project. One big issue I had/thing I learned is that you need to be careful about what you have inside a loop. If I'm assigning value to a variable inside of a loop, then that variable will be rewritten each time the loop runs. Instead of ending up with a long run of characters, I will only end up with the very last random character.

I also learned that if you're trying to push something into an array, and you don't have ... before the name of the variable you're trying to push, you actually won't be pushin anything.
